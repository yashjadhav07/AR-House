An augmented reality based mobile application for real estate purpose. This app is integrated with voice control functionality for hands free experience. The app have 3 phases:- 
1st phase:- A customer can watch an advertising video of the real estate site in a 3D world.

2nd phase:- here customer can superimpose a 3D model of the building/house/villa etc on a plane surface and can have overall look around the building/house/villa. He/she can also use voice controlled functionality like 'remove the roof', 'remove second floor', 'open the garage', 'show the house in night-time' etc and the following operations will get performed on the 3D model. This will help the customer to have more informative look at the site without physically visiting it. 

3rd phase:- here customer can get the first person view of the building/house/villa etc that means just like playing an video game they can walk inside the building/house/villa and can have a great look at the interior of the site.

And yes!!! This means customer can buy any property they wish without physically visiting it. This will help the real estate business in this corona pandemic.
